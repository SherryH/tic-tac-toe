# tic-tac-toe
This tic tac toe game has been adapted from [an assessment](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/KzXQgy) in FreeCodeCamp

A new implementation in jQuery has been done in the `jQueryImpl` folder in `index.html`, `interactions2.js` and `styles2.css`. The *2 player* feature was completed but not the *1 player* feature, so you are not able to play against the computer in the new implementation yet.

The attempt to rewrite the app using `React`, `React Router v4` and `Redux` has not been successful. Looks like I should not wrap the `App.js` into an `AppContainer.js` as it is the reason causing the in-page navigation to fail. It is better to create specific container for the component in use. This will be rewritten later.
